# Kyle's (Arguably) Amazing Final Graphics Engine
## Kyle Edwards, Period 5

### Excuse the lateness... Sorry :C

## Things I plan to add

- Multiple Lights
- Mesh importing
  - OBJ and STL files
- Set (Assign values to knobs)
- Saveknobs (Save values of knobs)
- Tween (Move between two knob lists)
- Shading revamp
  - Use uthash instead of a KD tree
- Save_Coordinate_System (Save a copy of the stack to the symbol table)
- Cylinders!

## Things I may not get to (but I hope I can!)
- Changing the behavior of vary (Add exponential, logarithmic, sinusodial)
- Texture mapping
- Anti-Aliasing
- Using vary to move lights
